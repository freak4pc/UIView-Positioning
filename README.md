UIView-Positioning
================
**UIView+Positioning** is an Objective-C Category which provides easy shorthand methods to defining the frame properties (width, height, x, y) of any UIView based object in an easy fashion, as well as extra helpful properties and methods.

USAGE
-----
Just use the properties **x**, **y**, **width**, **height** or use **origin** and **size** to kill two birds with one stone ;-)

```objc
UIButton *btnTest; // Or any other view

btnTest.width   = 250;
btnTest.height  = 100;

btnTest.y      -= 100;
btnTest.x      += 35;

btnTest.centerX = 20;
btnTest.centerY = 15;

btnTest.size    = CGSizeMake(150, 70);
btnTest.origin  = CGPointMake(25, 10);

NSLog(@"%f", btnTest.lastSubviewOnX.x); // X value of the object with the largest X value
NSLog(@"%f", btntest.lastSubviewOnY.y); // Y value of the object with the largest Y value

[btnTest centerToParent]; // Centers button to its parent view, if exists
```
